      'Hey there A.L.L gang, this is gonna be a tough one. For a while now, I’ve been worried for my co-author, and at this point I have to say something; y’all deserve to know. Ever since Tim Schill started talking about this “Jorie,” things have changed. He loses focus, neglects to post (yeah, there’s a reason you’ve been hearing from me a lot more recently), and misses obvious puns in convers-ape-tion. It even seems like sometimes he forgets why we started this blog in the first place. This was supposed to be about the apes, but, for him, I don’t know if it is anymore. I mean, you all read his last post, right? If he doesn’t snap out of it soon, I might need to find another partner for the blog.',
      'Which brings me to the real subject of this post. If Tim Schill isn’t able to run A.L.L. anymore, can he really be trusted with leadership of POTAS (WC) next year? This is the foundational chapter we’re talking about here, not some side project. We need someone with drive at the helm, someone who’s really chimping at the bit to celebrate all things simian. I used to think I could say that about Tim Schill, but now I’m not so sure. But what do you all think? Let me know in the comments (let’s be real, Tim doesn’t even read these anymore) if I need to find a replacement. And, as always, stay apes, stay together, stay strong.'
