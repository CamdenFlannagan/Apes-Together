    <p>
        Hi, I'm Tim Schill, member of the Planet of the Apes Society Wheaton Chapter and co-founder of A.L.L, Ape Loving Liberals. It was on a dark Thursday evening that my colleague Ben Zimmerman and I realized that we didn't have to separate our love for the Planet of the Apes films and our love for the liberal party. We found that our lives were enriched by this holistic view of life, and we made the decision to share it with the world.
